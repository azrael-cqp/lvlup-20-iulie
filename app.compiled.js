    full: "Artificial Intelligence is the broad field of making machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Within AI, Machine Learning (ML) is the approach where systems learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning is a subset of ML using neural networks with many layers. Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude are a specific type of deep learning model trained on vast amounts of text data.\n\nKey concepts to understand:\n• AI > Machine Learning > Deep Learning > LLMs\n• LLMs predict the next most likely token (word/piece of word)\n• They're trained on internet text, books, code, and more\n• They don't 'think' like humans — they're pattern recognition at massive scale\n\nToday's task: Ask Claude to explain what it is and how it works. Compare its answer with what you learned here."

    full: "Claude is built on the Transformer architecture, invented in 2017. Here's how it processes your messages:\n\n1. TOKENIZATION: Your text is broken into tokens (roughly 3/4 of a word each). 'Hello world' might become ['Hello', ' world'].\n\n2. CONTEXT WINDOW: Claude can 'see' up to 200K tokens at once — that's roughly 150K words or a full novel. Everything in your conversation sits in this window.\n\n3. ATTENTION: The transformer looks at relationships between ALL tokens simultaneously. This is what makes it powerful — it understands context.\n\n4. GENERATION: Claude produces one token at a time, choosing the most appropriate next token based on everything it's seen. This is why it 'streams' text.\n\n5. RLHF: Claude was fine-tuned using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback to be helpful, harmless, and honest.\n\nToday's task: Ask Claude 'How many tokens is this message?' and experiment with how it handles different input sizes."

INSTRUCTION: 'Summarize this article in 3 bullet points'\n3. BRAINSTORM: 'Give me 10 business ideas for someone who loves fitness'\n4. ANALYSIS: 'What are the pros and cons of remote work?'\n5. CREATION: 'Write a professional email declining a meeting'\n6. EXPLANATION: 'Explain quantum computing like I'm 12'\n7. TRANSLATION: 'Translate this to Spanish and explain the grammar'\n8. ROLEPLAY: 'Act as a personal trainer and create a meal plan'\n9. DEBUGGING: 'Why isn't this code working? [paste code]'\n10. COMPARISON: 'Compare React vs Vue for a beginner'\n\nNotice how each prompt type gives Claude a clear task. The more specific you are, the better Claude performs.\n\nToday's task: Try all 10 prompt types. Note which ones give you the best results and why."

ChatGPT Plus includes image generation.\n\nGEMINI (Google): Integrated with Google services. Strong at multimodal tasks (text + image + video). Good for research with Google Search integration.\n\nWhen to use Claude:\n• Long document analysis\n• Complex writing tasks\n• Coding with detailed explanations\n• Tasks requiring careful reasoning\n• When you need honesty about limitations\n\nToday's task: Ask the same complex question to Claude and another AI.

Claude is trained to say 'I don't know' but it's not perfect.\n\nBIAS: AI models reflect biases in their training data. Be aware of this in hiring decisions, legal advice, medical information, etc.\n\nPRIVACY: Don't share sensitive personal data, passwords, or confidential business information in AI chats unless you understand the privacy policy.\n\nCOPYRIGHT: AI-generated content exists in a legal grey area. Don't claim AI writing as your own in academic settings.\n\nDEPENDENCY: Use AI as a tool to augment your abilities, not replace your thinking. The goal is AI + Human > either alone.\n\nANTHROPIC'S APPROACH: Anthropic (Claude's creator) focuses on AI safety research.

Good AI products follow these principles:\n\nWHEN TO USE AI:\n• Task is language-heavy (writing, analysis, conversation)\n• Input is unstructured (free text, images, audio)\n• Perfect accuracy isn't required\n• Human-in-the-loop is possible\n• The task would take a human significant time\n\nWHEN NOT TO USE AI:\n• Simple CRUD operations\n• Precise calculations\n• Real-time requirements (<100ms)\n• When wrong answers are dangerous\n\nUX PRINCIPLES:\n• Show confidence levels\n• Allow easy correction\n• Explain AI reasoning\n• Graceful degradation when AI fails\n• Set clear expectations\n\nToday: Analyze 3 AI products you use.

Anthropic caches repeated content — you pay less for cached tokens.\n\nTOKEN BUDGETING:\n• Set appropriate max_tokens\n• Ask for concise responses\n• Summarize long contexts instead of sending full text\n• Remove unnecessary instructions\n\nARCHITECTURE:\n• Cache AI responses for identical queries\n• Use traditional code for deterministic parts\n• Only call Claude when AI reasoning is needed\n\nToday: Audit one of your existing Claude workflows.
